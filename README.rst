airtime-pie-chart
=================

Airtime Pie Chart is a tool to evaluate used airtime of IEEE 802.11 / WiFi
stations and illustrate them in a Pie Chart.

This tool has been created as part of the fair airtime scheduling research
at Open-Mesh Inc.

Compilation
===========

airtime_analyzer depends on:

* libpcap development files

airtime-pie-chart depends on:

* GNU R

To compile airtime_analyzer, simply type::

  make

 
Capture WiFi input data
=======================

A monitor interface has to be created to capture the radiotap information
for each packet. Make sure that network manager is disabled before trying
to create this device::

  iw phy phy0 interface add mon type monitor flags control
  ip link set up dev mon

Make sure that no other tool converted the new monitor interface back to
a managed interface::

  iw dev

Set the correct channel and channel width::

  iw dev mon set channel 11 HT20

Capture the radiotap information and the start of the packets::

  tcpdump -i mon -s 200 -w aircap.pcap

The capture can be stopped at any time via CTRL+C


Analyze the pcap file
=====================

The airtime_analyzer can parse the airtime.pcap and calculate for each
mac address how much time was spend sending it traffic. This
data should be stored in a text file to create a pie chart via
airtime-pie-chart.R::

  ./airtime_analyzer aircap.pcap > airtime-pie-chart.dat


Generate PIE chart
==================

The data file generated in the previous step can be send through GNU R
to generate a simple PIE chart::

  R --no-save < airtime-pie-chart.R
  xdg-open airtime-pie-chart.png
